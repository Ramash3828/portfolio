                technology for creating my web application. And I had to face
                many problems while doing the projects. I had to spend a lot of

                Google, Stack Overflow and other means. Those are definitely
                small mistakes. When I first did the project, I almost made
                mistakes step by step. It took him up to two days to fix the
                mistakes. But I solved it. If one of my habits gets stuck
                somewhere, I stick to it until it is resolved. Which is why I
